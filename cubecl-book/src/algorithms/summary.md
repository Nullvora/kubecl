# Algorithm reference

In this section,
we introduce different algorithms provided by CubeCL.
This is a best effort list and we focus first on nontrivial algorithms
deserving more explanations than what is reasonable to put in the API documentation.
This section is also a bit more technical compared to the others, as it serves two purposes.
First, it is a reference for users interested in the lower-level details of CubeCL.
Second, it is a reference for the developers who want to update the implementation as
the algorithms often get obfuscated by optimization details.
