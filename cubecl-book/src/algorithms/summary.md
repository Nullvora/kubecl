# Algorithm reference

In this section,
we introduce different algorithms provided by CubeCL.
This is a best effort list and we focus first on non-trivial algorithms
deserving more explanations than what is reasonable to put in the API documentation.
Also, this section is a bit more technical compare to the others as it serve two purpose.
First, it is a reference for users interested in the lower-level details of CubeCL.
Second, it is a reference for the developers that want to update the implementation as
the algorithms often get offuscated by optimization details.
