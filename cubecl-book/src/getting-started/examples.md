# Examples

For now we only have a limited amount of examples listed in the table below. Note that you can also
look at how the [matmul](https://github.com/tracel-ai/cubecl/tree/main/crates/cubecl-matmul) is
implemented. Don't hesitate to contribute more examples to the CubeCL repository!

| Example                                                                                 | Description                                                                                             |

| [GeLU](https://github.com/tracel-ai/cubecl/tree/main/examples/gelu)                     | Implement the GeLU activation function using CubeCL.                                                    |
| [Sum Things](https://github.com/tracel-ai/cubecl/tree/main/examples/sum_things)         | Sum some numbers using many different variations leveraging the CubeCL core features and trait support. |
| [Normalization](https://github.com/tracel-ai/cubecl/tree/main/examples/normalization)   | Show how to use normalization on vectorized elements.                                                   |
| [Device Sharing](https://github.com/tracel-ai/cubecl/tree/main/examples/device_sharing) | Share a WGPU device with CubeCL and other service.                                                      |
| [Fusing](https://github.com/tracel-ai/cubecl/tree/main/examples/fusing)                 | Use comptime to select operation                                                                        |
