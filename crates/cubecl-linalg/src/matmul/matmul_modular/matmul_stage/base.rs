/// Provides matrix multiplication operations at the stage level.
///
/// At the stage level,
///  - Inputs are staged into an intermediate memory called stage (typically a shared memory).
///  - All planes within a Cube can collaborate to solve the problem
///  - Dimensions M, N and K are fixed to an integer, and the
///    matrix multiplication works only for size (M, K) Â· (K, N) = (M, N).
///    These integers are multiples of the underlying Tile matmul,
///    corresponding to the number of tiles in each dimension.
///
/// Assumptions:
///  - Data given as inputs by stage readers must always be valid. If the actual matrix multiplication
///    should be done on smaller sizes than M, N and K, padding with zeros must be done beforehand.
///  - Enough planes are launched to perform the whole computation
