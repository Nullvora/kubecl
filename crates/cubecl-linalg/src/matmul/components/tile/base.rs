/// Provides matrix multiplication operations at the tile level.

/// At the tile level,
///  - Inputs are raw slices of data, called tiles.
///  - units within one plane can collaborate to solve the problem
///  - dimensions M, N and K are fixed to an integer, and the
///    matrix multiplication works only for size (M, K) Â· (K, N) = (M, N).
///
/// Assumptions:
///  - Slices given as inputs must always be valid. If the actual matrix multiplication
///    should be done on smaller sizes than M, N and K, padding with zeros must be done beforehand.
///  - Enough units are present to perform the whole computation
