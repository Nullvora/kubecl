///    only parts of the global memory inputs at once.
///  - All planes within a Cube can collaborate to solve the problem
///  - Dimensions M and N are fixed to an integer, but K is arbitrary large.
///    The matrix multiplication works only for size (M, _) Â· (_, N) = (M, N).
///    M and N should match the underlying Stage matmul's M and N.
///
/// # Assumptions
/// - Line sizes of the inputs evenly divide the dimension they are aligned with.
///
/// # Safety
///
/// It is not assumed that the matmul's dimensions match its inputs dimensions perfectly.
/// It is therefore important that Loaders and Unloaders perform checks to avoid out-of-bounds
/// before loading data.
